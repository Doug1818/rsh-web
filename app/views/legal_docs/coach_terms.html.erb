      <h2 class="center">RIGHT SIDE TECHNOLOGIES<br>TERMS OF SERVICE FOR COACHES</h2>
			<p>Welcome to Right Side Technologies!  The Website and the App (each as defined below) are provided by Right Side Technologies, Inc. (“Right Side”, “we”, “us” or “our”).  These terms of service (these “Terms of Service”) govern your (“you” or “your”) access to and use of the <%= link_to 'www.mystepsapp.com', root_path, target: "_blank" %> web site and its subdomains (collectively, together with the App, the “Website”), downloadable applications we make available to you (collectively, the “App”), and all software and services provided by Right Side via the Website (collectively, the “Services”).</p>
			<p>The Website and Services enable a health, wellness or other coach, which may be a gym instructor, dietitian, physical therapist, life coach, executive coach or other health provider (a “Coach”), to collect data about certain behaviors or activities of end users (“End Users”) that those End Users choose to track through their mobile devices in combination with personal information submitted by those End Users to us in order to provide those End Users with notices and feedback to help the End User try to maintain or achieve certain behavioral goals, such as following a diet, exercise or health plan.  End Users may either self-report data through the Services or the data may be automatically collected by the End User’s mobile device (such as GPS, accelerometers, etc.) (any personal data about you submitted or collected through the Website, your “App Data”).  Through our Services, an End User can receive push notifications of reminders or metrics regarding certain behaviors that the End User chooses to track through the Services.  Our Service may permit an End User to disclose the End User’s App Data to a third party from time to time; provided that the End User does so at the End User’s own risk.  In order to use the Services, you must have a mobile device enabled with our downloadable application, or use the Services through a computer or device that can access our Website.  </p>
			<p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY, AS THEY CONTAIN AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, WHICH REQUIRES THAT YOU AND RIGHT SIDE ARBITRATE CERTAIN CLAIMS BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION INSTEAD OF GOING TO COURT AND LIMITS CLASS ACTION CLAIMS, UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE AS DESCRIBED IN THE ARBITRATION SECTION (SEE SECTION 21 "AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE").</p>

You and Right Side shall appoint as sole arbitrator a person mutually agreed by you and Right Side or, if you and Right Side cannot agree within thirty (30) days of either party’s request for arbitration, such single arbitrator shall be selected by the AAA upon the request of either party.  The parties shall bear equally the cost of the arbitration (except that the prevailing party shall be entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with the arbitration in such an amount as may be determined by the arbitrator).
